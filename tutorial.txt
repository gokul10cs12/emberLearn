    Component -? reusable and configurable unit.
---> Tracked properties and Getter.
    @tracked added to the property inside a component, it is to identify and update the latest changes to the property

    @tracked firstName = "gokul";
    @tracker secondName = "nb";
    get fullName(){
      return firstName + lastName;
    }
  By this we can get the initialized name to the dom (since everything is checked and upto date).
  <h1> this.fullName</h1>

  action is a method which has @action decorator which can be used in the template.
  eg in js file:
      @tracked number = 0;
        @action
        addNumber(){
        this.number = this.number + 1;
        }
     in DOM:
     <h1> Number {{this.name}}
     <button {{ on "click" this.addNumber}}> add </button>

      export default class Parent extends Component{
        propP = 1;
      }
      export default class Child extends Component{
        propC = 1;
      }

      Parent.hbs
          <Child @propP={{this.propP}}>
      Child.hbs
          <h1>Child Property : {{this.propChild}}</h1>
